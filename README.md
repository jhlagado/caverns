This is my old program *Caverns*, released in 1983, the same year as the TEC-1. It was the first substantial program that I wrote and I'm glad to see it again after all these years. I was lucky that the game got preserved by collectors over the years even though the program was not really that well known. It's kind of a miracle that it wasn't lost in the intervening 35 years.

*Caverns* began life as a text adventure game for the Sinclair ZX81 (16K extension) back in 1982. Not long after that my friend Ken Stone and I hand-ported it across to his Commodore VIC-20 and we worked on it together there. Then finally I transferred it yet again, this time to the Microbee. Each port led to various modifications and extensions. The Microbee version integrated many of the things I had learned.

It's a supreme piece of spaghetti code written in BASIC!

You can find advertisements in Talking Electronics magazine where we sold the program on cassette. The ad for Ken's Vic-20 version can be seen in Issue 8 and  my Microbee version can be seen as in a full-page ad in Issue 10. Yes, in those days, software was still so rare, you could actually sell it! I've put a few samples in the adverts folder of this repo.

Later in 1983, the program came to be distributed by Lindsay R Ford's Dreamcards company as a so-called "DUO" pack, that is, bundled with another program. That other program was *Hyperdrive II*, a scifi influenced text adventure based on a story by Ken Stone and an earlier version of the game that he had written for the Vic-20. The version for the Microbee was a reworking by me using mostly the same BASIC "engine" that ran in *Caverns*. *Hyperdrive II* draws on the experience gained in writing *Caverns* and is more ambitious and slightly more advanced. Unfortunately the Vic-20 versions of both games appear to have been lost to the ages. That's what makes the survival of the Microbee versions especially remarkable.

Right here I'd like to stop and say thank you to the [Microbee Software Preservation Project](https://microbee-mspp.org.au) and especially to Alan Laughton (aka ChickenMan) who was critical in compiling the disks of files that these games got preserved on. But I'd especially like to thank Alan for his help and generosity in helping me recover the original text of the programs and for pointing me in the right direction. I'm doing my bit for the preservation of my tiny piece of Microbee software but releasing the source code under the GNU Public License.

Also included in this repo is a node script that I wrote for reading Microbee MicroWorld Basic files (MWB)and converting their tokens back into something human readable.

Note: the cover image is taken from the [NanoWasp emulator](http://nanowasp.org/). As, I currently no longer own a Microbee. I may have to see if I can correct that situation at some stage.
