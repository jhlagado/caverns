This is my old program *Caverns*, released in 1983, the same year as the TEC-1. It was the first substantial program that I wrote and I'm glad to see it again after all these years. I was lucky that the game got preserved along with lots of other things in the Microbee world although the program was not really that well known. It's kind of a miracle that it wasn't lost in the intervening 35 years.

This program started life as a text adventure game for the Sinclair ZX81 (16K extension) back in 1982. Not long after that Ken Stone and I hand-ported it across to his Commodore VIC-20 and we worked together on it there. Then finally I transferred it yet again, this time to the Microbee.

You can find advertisements in Talking Electronics magazine where we sold the program on cassette. The ad for Ken's Vic-20 version can be seen in Issue 8 and the my Microbee version in Issue 10. Yes, in those days, software was still so rare, you could actually sell it! I've preserved a few samples in the adverts folder.

In 1984, the program was distributed by Lindsay R Ford's Dreamcards company as a so-called "duo", that is a bundle with another program. That other program was *Hyperdrive II*, a scifi influenced text adventure based on a story by Ken Stone and an earlier version of the game he wrote for the Vic-20. The version for the Microbee was a reworking by me using the same BASIC "engine" that ran in Caverns. Hyperdrive draws on the experience of writing Caverns and is more ambitious and slightly more advanced. Unfortunately the Vic-20 versions of both games appear to have been lost to the ages. That's what makes the survival of the Microbee versions especially remarkable.

Right here I'd like to say thank you to the [Microbee Software Preservation Project](https://microbee-mspp.org.au) and especially to Alan Laughton who was critical in finding and compiling the disks that these games got preserved on. But I'd especially like to thank Alan for his help and generosity in helping me recover the original text of the programs and pointing me in the right direction. I'm doing my bit for the preservation of my tiny piece of Microbee software but releasing the source code under the GNU Public License.

It's runnable but still has a lot of bugs in it introduced by the transfer. I'm close to having the bugs out that were introduced by the imperfect transfer from a .WAV file to binary and then finally de-tokenised and back into it's original MicroWorld Basic.

I'm releasing it so that it's free for anyone to use under the GNU public license.
