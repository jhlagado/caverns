# Recovery Notes

Caverns survived through hobbyist collections and was preserved as part of the
Microbee Software Preservation Project. Alan Laughton (aka ChickenMan) helped
locate the preservation media and guided the recovery of the original program
text, making it possible to reconstruct a readable BASIC listing.

The Microbee version appears to be the most complete surviving form of the
game. Earlier ZX81 and VIC-20 variants are referenced in period advertising but
do not seem to have endured. The recovered listing is released under the GNU
Public License, matching the 2019 release note embedded in the program itself.
