00021CLS:PRINT"The sign reads as follows..."
00022SPEED120:PRINT"Deep in the icy mountains of northern Iotunheim there lived     a small band of elves who called themselves `The Great Sons of  Svartalfheim.'"
00023PRINT"These elves worked day and night deep underground in the        limestone caves, mining for precious minerals which they        fashioned into jewellery."
00024PRINT"So prized were their products that merchants and traders came   from distant Asgar and Fenris to purchase them."
00025PRINT"The elves became very prosperous and built a mighty empire deep underground which linked all the mines to a central city."
00026PRINT"Then one day, the King of the Danes, who was a very greedy man, sent his troops into the mines to sack the golden city. Every   elf found was to be brought to the Royal ";
00027PRINT"Palace to work in the  foundry. This was done and all the inhabitants of Svartalfheim  were forced to live within the city walls. "
00028PRINT"Suddenly, to the surprise of all around, the elves began to die as if of some strange illness. Nothing could be done to save"
00029PRINT"them and within a few weeks all of the elves were dead and their";
00030PRINT"wonderful gifts lost forever. The King was furious and executed several of his courtesans, but the damage had already been done." 
00031PRINT"Centuries passed and the story of Svartalfheim faded from memoryuntil one day a goatherd called Peter ran into town with an     incredible story."
00032PRINT"`Way up in the hills,' he said, `is the entrance to a cave      guarded by a green serpent that breathes flames!'"
00033PRINT"Peter told a story of how he managed to escape the fiery breath of the dragon and found a tiny room filled with more gold and   silver than he could possibly carry."
00034PRINT"The only jewel he could bring back to prove his story was a tinyruby ring which had obviously been crafted with great skill."
00035PRINT"Peter led a group of his fellow villagers back up into the      mountains beyond Mt. Ymir, but they were all killed in a rock"
00036PRINT"fall before they could reach the entrance. So Svartalfheim was  once again lost and stories of its hidden treasures became      myths."\
00037PRINT"It is four hundred years since the days of Peter the goatherd   and you have come to Iotunheim to search for the treasure your-"
00038PRINT"self. You followed the valley to a forest in the foothills of   Ymir and set up a base in a small hut which at one time belongedto a hermit."
